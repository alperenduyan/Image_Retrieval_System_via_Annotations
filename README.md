# Image_Retrieval_System_via_Annotations

This system retrieves similar images to the dataset we created from COCO dataset. To use this Under static file create a new file and name it coco. Inside coco file, a new file must be created with name val2014 and paste all COCO images in that folder.

Also from COCO dataset annotations file must be created and json files from COCO dataset must be placed in this file.

After downloading required data, first precompute.py must be run once to do the required setup. After that app.py can be run.
